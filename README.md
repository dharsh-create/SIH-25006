# 🐖🐓 Digital Farm Management Portal for Biosecurity

### Smart India Hackathon 2025 – Problem ID: SIH25006
### Register Number: 212223040038
### Name: DHARSHINI V
### Organization: Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying
### Theme: Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## 📘 Problem Description
###  Background
Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause severe economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods.
However, small and marginal farmers often struggle to access practical information about biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance.

## Problem Description
There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity measures.
The proposed portal should provide:
🧩 Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological data.
📚 Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines.
✅ Compliance tracking aligned with regulatory frameworks.
🚨 Real-time alerts for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
🌐 Multilingual, mobile-first design for rural accessibility.
Additionally, it should allow data collection for policy-making, networking among stakeholders, and promote long-term livestock sector resilience.

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes
Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
Improved risk management and self-assessment at the farm level.
Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and digital records.
Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
Healthier livestock and higher productivity.
Empowerment of small and marginal farmers.
Support for authorities in data-driven disease surveillance.
Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A Digital Farm Management Portal designed specifically for pig and poultry farms, helping farmers easily adopt and maintain biosecurity practices.

### 🧠 Key Features
Smart Risk Assessment: AI-based scoring for disease vulnerability.
Training Hub: Local-language videos, guides, and gamified learning.
Compliance Tracker: Digital logs for hygiene, vaccination, and farm entry.
Real-Time Alerts: Notifications about nearby disease outbreaks.
Dashboard: Real-time analytics for farmers and government authorities.
